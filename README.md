# Minesweeper-using-python
A python project to to learn randomisation.
I also made use of Tkinter GUI. 

# Some feautures:

1. The game displays the number of mines on every side of the clicked cell.
2. If it has no mines on one side, the cell is opened automatically, as that is the next logical step.
3. User can mark the places where they suspect a mine to be present, by using the left click on the mouse. The box gets highlighted in orange.
4. If the user clicks on a mine, the game is over.
5. There is an automatic counter that shows the number of boxes unopened.
6. Randomisation obtained is very good, and it is very hard to beat the game.
# Output and Functioning:

This is the general view of the game. There is a cell counter, as well as the rules for the game.

The player has clicked on a cell, ant the number of mines surrounding it are shown. Player is also shown highlighting would-be mines. Notice that the cell count decreases as player clicks on the cells.

Alas, the player has clicked on a mine. This means that the game is over!
